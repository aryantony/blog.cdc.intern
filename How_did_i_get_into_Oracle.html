                    <b class="bd">Coding Round</b>: The first stage was a 90-min online coding test. The test comprised 2
                    coding
                    questions and 20 MCQs. I would estimate the complexity of the coding questions to be medium to hard on the LeetCode scale. Both the coding questions and MCQs are typically tricky and often revolve around puzzles and code snippets. I did quite well in the test
                    —100% of test cases passed for both questions and was moderately confident about expecting a shortlist.
                    </br> </br>
                    <b class="bd">Shortlisting Criteria</b>: Shortlists were announced based on test performance. If you did
                    all
                    questions of the test then you might be shortlisted based on department or CGPA.
                    </br> </br>
                    <b class="bd">Interview</b>: Oracle comes with a total of 8 people, having 6 interviewers and 2 HR. All
                interview round
                was offline. All the round of interview was 1-1. I was the only person who had been shortlisted from the
                non-circuital department, that’s why I had 3-technical rounds and 1-HR rounds but circuital people have
                only 2-technical and 1-HR rounds.
                </br>
                </br>
                <b class="bd">Round 1</b>: I was a bit confused at the beginning when I had to introduce myself because
                I felt really
                nervous. This was my first time having a one-on-one interview in person, which made things even harder.
                As a result, I had trouble speaking clearly because I was unsure of myself. Thankfully, the interviewer
                kindly offered me some water, which gave me a short break and helped me calm down. After that, being in
                the interviewer's friendly presence made me feel more comfortable.
                To assess my technical acumen, I was provided with a pen and a set of A4-sized sheets to transcribe the
                code from the '#include' statement to the 'return 0' statement within the main function. It's noteworthy
                that I was not allowed to utilize function snippets, a caveat unique to my circumstance as someone with
                a non-circuit background.
                During our talk, the interviewer asked me questions based on <b>binary trees, using trees in dynamic
                    programming, and topological sorting</b>. They also wanted to know about my past internships. What
                made it
                interesting was that I had to figure out and write the solutions for these coding problems on paper
                right then and there. I'd never done that before, so it was quite tough. But as we continued talking and
                I got more comfortable with the interviewer, my nervousness started to fade away. It was surprising how
                smoothly this happened, and I found it easier to handle the challenges that came up.
                </br>
                </br>
                <b class="bd">Round 2</b>: This round was the same as the previous one, I had to write the coding
                question’s answer on
                paper. This round was a bit tough than the previous one where all the question was standard type like
                <b>finding the sum in the range of each query using segment tree, knapsack dp with binary search, and
                    standard bitmask dp(leetcode hard problem)</b>. Writing each question’s code from scratch was the
                only
                difficult part of this round. The interviewer also asked me more about my CV and my college courses. It
                was like they were asking me to explain what I had done before.
                </br>
                </br>
                <b class="bd">Round 3</b>: This round was completely harder of all. I would estimate the question
                complexity to span
                1400–1600 Codeforces ratings or so, the questions were definitely of a slightly higher level than the
                average CDC coding interviews that season. All questions need attention.
                </br>
                <b>“All these three rounds had taken around 60-70 minutes each. So having patience is required.”</b>
                </br>
                </br>
                <b class="bd">Round 4 [HR]</b>: My starting question was “In my world of computer science, how can I
                help some
                non-circuital guy”. I answered gently and shared my experience in three internships in web development
                along with what I learned from them. He seemed pleased with my response. I also mentioned that I'm good
                at OOPs (which stands for Object-Oriented Programming). After all the technical questions, he asked
                about my day and the company. We had a casual chat that lasted around 25-30 minutes.
