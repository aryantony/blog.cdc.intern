        <h4>How to prepare for them?</h4>
        <p> “Here are some ideas to help you prepare for interviews at software companies on day-1 and day-2. Please
          follow these tips”
          </br></br>
          <b class="bd">~</b> During your winter vacation (December), take a course called Algozenth - 201. If
          you're new to
          programming concepts like the 'printf' statement in the C language, start from scratch and build your
          foundation in this one month. Even if you've taken the course before, it's a good way to reinforce your
          skills.
          </br></br>
          <b class="bd">~</b> During the summer vacation, which is around 60-80 days, start working on LeetCode
          problems once
          you've completed about 40-50% of the Algozenith 201 courses. Focus on dynamic programming and
          graph-related problems. Aim to solve at least 100-150 (dp + graph) LeetCode questions to become
          proficient."Before watching the DP and graph videos from Algozenith, make sure to watch the videos on
          YouTube by 'Strive' for both DP and graphs (highly recommended)."
          </br></br>
          <b class="bd">~</b> As you complete around 20% of the Algozenith course, begin participating in the ABC
          contest (AtCoder
          Beginner Contest) held every Saturday at 5:30 PM. The first four questions are relatively easier, while
          the last four require more attention. If you can't solve a problem during the contest, try working on it
          after the contest (**very important).
          </br></br>
          <b class="bd">~</b> In the final weeks leading up to interviews, learn Computer Science concepts related
          to
          Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). Watch lectures 6 to 18 of the 'C++ by Saurabh Shukla' series and
          practice all the OOPs questions on InterviewBit (there are about 50 multiple-choice questions). If you
          have time, you can also explore subjects like Operating Systems (OS), Databases (DBMS), and Networking
          for additional knowledge(+ point).
          </br>
